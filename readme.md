VaraniumSharp wrapper for OIDC.
This is the same logic that was originally in [VaraniumSharp.Initiator](https://github.com/NinetailLabs/VaraniumSharp.Initiator/tree/master/VaraniumSharp.Initiator/Security), now just moved to it's own project as Initiator is being retired.

For a detailed overview of the library see our [documentation](https://ninetaillabs.github.io/VaraniumSharp.Oidc/index.html)
